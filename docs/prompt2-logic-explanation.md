# ðŸ“˜ Prompt 2 â€“ Step-by-Step Logic Breakdown

This file outlines the overall logic and structure of the project workflow from raw data to prediction, following the machine learning pipeline. Each step was designed to support model performance and interpretability for predicting well functionality in rural Tanzania.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Load and Inspect Data

- Defined a function `load_data_and_check_info()` to:
  - Load the CSV using pandas.
  - Display dataset shape and structure.
  - Show the first few rows and data types.
- Purpose: To understand dataset size, structure, and basic issues (e.g. nulls, dtypes).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Explore Unique Values in Categorical Columns

- Created a function `check_unique()` to print:
  - Each columnâ€™s name, number of unique values, and actual unique values.
- Purpose: To assess data variability, detect possible redundancy, and inform preprocessing.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Visualize Missing Values

- Used `seaborn` heatmap to visualize null values.
- Purpose: Understand which columns have missing data and estimate their severity visually.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Drop Unnecessary or Sparse Columns

- Dropped columns such as:
  - `funder`, `installer`, `scheme_name`, `region_code`, etc.
- Reason: Many had too many missing values or were deemed non-contributive to model performance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Handle Missing Values

- Applied forward-fill and median strategies to impute:
  - Features like `construction_year`, `public_meeting`, `permit`, etc.
- Purpose: Prepare the data for clean model input and avoid dropped rows.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Encode Categorical Variables

- Applied label encoding or one-hot encoding for:
  - Features like `management`, `payment_type`, `water_quality`, etc.
- Purpose: Convert strings into numeric values interpretable by ML models.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Define Features and Target

- Set `X` (features) and `y` (target: `status_group`).
- Purpose: Separate predictors from the label for supervised learning.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Split Dataset into Training and Testing

- Used `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` with a 70:30 ratio.
- Purpose: Ensure fair model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Train Multiple Classifiers

- Models trained:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Purpose: Compare performance to select the most robust and accurate model.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Evaluate Model Performance

- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1)
- Purpose: Understand how well the model performs in predicting well functionality.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 11: Feature Importance (Random Forest)

- Used `.feature_importances_` to extract which features contributed most to predictions.
- Purpose: Provide explainability and real-world insight for policy recommendations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 12: Generate Recommendations

- Based on feature importance and model results, proposed:
  - Prioritizing regions with low functionality
  - Focusing maintenance in spring-based wells
  - Monitoring population and quantity-related fields

---

## âœ… Outcome

The structured workflow produced a model with strong performance and explainability. The model can support NGOs and governments in prioritizing well maintenance and expansion based on data-driven insights.
