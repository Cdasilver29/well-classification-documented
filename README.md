# # Tanzania Water Wells ‚Äì Documented ML Project
![alt text](Well_IMAGE1-1.jpeg)

This is a cleaned and documented version of my original project predicting the functionality of water wells in rural Tanzania.

 ## <li> **Business Understanding**
Tanzania faces a water crisis due to limited infrastructure, uneven distribution, poor water quality, climate change, and population growth. We are working on a project that utilizes machine learning to predict well success, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately break the cycle of water insecurity and poverty.

## <li> **Project Goal**
Our goal in this project is to utilize machine learning algarithms to build a model predicting water point functionality in Tanzania. This empowers Tanzanian authorities to identify wells needing maintenance, guide future well placement for better success rates, and ultimately optimize water resource management across the country. By predicting well functionality, the model can help target limited resources for repairs, inform data-driven decisions on new well construction, and promote efficient water utilization, tackling Tanzania's water crisis head-on.

## üß† Purpose

This repository was created to fulfill a code documentation exercise as part of a generative AI learning module. It includes:

- Final notebook with code explanations
- Function-level documentation
- Step-by-step logic breakdown
- Educational structure for others to reuse or understand the codebase

## <li> Findings
* Water Quality: Soft water pumps tend to be more functional.
* Water Availability: Waterpoints with sufficient water are most functional.

* Regional Disparity:

1. Iringa, Kilimanjaro, and Shinyanga have the most functional pumps.
2. Kilimanjaro and Mbeya have the most non-functional pumps.
3. Kigoma has the most waterpoints needing repair.

* Water Source:

1. Springs and shallow wells have the most functional pumps.
2. Springs have the most frequently repaired functional pumps.
3. Shallow wells and boreholes have the most non-functional pumps.

* Water Scarcity: Waterpoints with insufficient water have very few functional pumps.

## <li> Recommendations

* Prioritize Springs: Build new waterpoints near springs whenever possible to extend pump life.
* Monitor Abundant Sources: Keep a close eye on high-water table wells to prevent overuse and pump failure.

## <li> Next step

Continuously improve the model for well pump prediction to optimize maintenance resource allocation.
